Great — using SMS as a fallback or parallel system alongside WhatsApp makes Kuzi more robust, especially in areas where WhatsApp is unreliable or vendors/riders use feature phones.

📩 1. Requirements for SMS Integration
✅ Essentials:
Requirement
	Notes
	SMS Gateway Provider
	E.g., Termii, Twilio, Africa’s Talking, InfoBip
	Phone Number Collection
	Must collect vendor/rider phone numbers at onboarding
	Backend Logic
	Your system must listen to SMS replies via webhook or polling
	Message Cost Management
	SMS is paid per message — keep messages concise
	Delivery Retry Logic
	Handle failed deliveries, timeouts, and fallback escalation
	

🧩 2. SMS-Based Workflow for Kuzi
A. Vendor Availability Ping
SMS Sent to Vendor:
Kuzi: Do you have [Product Name] in stock near [Location]?
Reply:
1 = Yes
2 = No
3 = Only [X] left


Expected Reply:
* “1” → Available

* “2” → Unavailable

* “3” or “Only 2 left” → Partial availability

System Action:
   * Parse vendor reply via webhook

   * Mark item as “confirmed” or “insufficient”

   * Time out after 2 minutes → ping next vendor

B. Rider Dispatch Alert
SMS Sent to Rider:
Kuzi Store Delivery:
Pickup: [Vendor Area]
Dropoff: [Customer Area]
Payment: [Paid/POD]
Reply YES to accept


Expected Reply:
      * “YES” or “ACCEPT” → Assign rider

      * No response → Ping next available rider

________________


C. Customer Notifications (Optional)
We can also use SMS to notify customers of order milestones:
Order Confirmation:

Kuzi Store: Order #12345 confirmed. ETA: 40 mins.




Out for Delivery:

Kuzi Store: Your rider [James] is en route. ETA: 20 mins.
Delivery Completed:

Kuzi Store: Your order has been delivered. Need help? Call 0900-xxx-xxx.

⚙️ 3. System Architecture for SMS Support
🔄 Flow:
         1. Backend triggers SMS via API (e.g., Termii/Twilio)

         2. Vendor/Rider replies go to your webhook (or retrieved via polling)

         3. Backend parses the reply and updates the system state

         4. If no reply within timeout (e.g. 2–3 minutes), fallback kicks in (ping next vendor/rider)

✅ Best Practices
            * Keep messages within 160 characters (1 SMS credit)

            * Avoid long dynamic text — use product short codes if possible

            * Always include fallback or escalation (if no reply)

            * Log all SMS activity for transparency and debugging
            *
